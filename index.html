    <p>There have been many famous soccer players throughout history. They have been national heroes and won the World Cup for their country. I will list several great players that I think are <i>amazing</i>.</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <h4 id="Dempsey">Clint Dempsey</h4>
    <p>He was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nacogdoches,_Texas" target="_blank">Nacogdoches</a>, Texas and lived in a trailer park. He played with Mexican immigrants and later on joined the Dallas Texans. He is the only U.S player that played and scored in three World Cups. In 2014 he scored the 5th fastest goal in World Cup history in 29 seconds. He plays in the MLS (Major League Soccer) for the Seattle Sounders as a forward/midfield. </p>
    
    <h4>Adelino Gonsalves</h4>
    <p>He played in many different professional U.S teams and holds the record for playing on the most National Challenge Cup teams that won. In 1930 and 1934 he played in the World Cup as a forward. He was one of the first to be put in the U.S National Soccer Hall of Fame in 1950.</p>

    <h4>Lionel Messi</h4>
    <p>Lionel was born on the 24<sup>th</sup> of June in 1987. Messi is on his way to surpass his predecessor Maradona. He is a left footed <b>Argentine</b> that plays forward and midfield. His first professional team he played on was FC Barcelona. He still plays for Barcelona and it is the only team, besides Argentina, he has played for. He has scored over 400 goals for Argentina and Barcelona in his entire career. Today he is called the best player in the world.</p>
    
    <h4>Pelé</h4>
    <p>Pele is called the best forward of all time with 1,282 goals in 1,363 games. The Brazilian was so good that the president of Brazil declared him a <span>national treasure</span> and he was not allowed to play for any team outisde of Brazil. He started his professional career at the age of 15. Out of the 4 World Cups he played in his team won 3 of them.</p>
